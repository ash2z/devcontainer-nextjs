# Project Overview

## Purpose

This is a Next.js 15 application template designed for rapid development with modern web technologies. It serves as a foundation for building full-stack web applications with server-side rendering, API routes, and modern React features.

## Tech Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Next.js 15**: Latest version with App Router for file-based routing
- **React 19**: Cutting-edge React with Server Components as default
- **TypeScript 5**: Strict mode enabled for type safety (target: ES2024)
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Utility-first CSS framework with PostCSS
- **Turbopack**: Fast development builds (enabled by default in dev mode)

### Development Tools

- **ESLint 9**: Modern flat config with extensive rules for code quality
- **Prettier 3.6**: Code formatting with Tailwind plugin integration
- **Jest 30**: Testing framework with ts-jest for TypeScript
- **Testing Library**: React testing utilities with jsdom environment

### Key Features

- Server Components by default for optimal performance
- Client Components only when needed (marked with 'use client')
- Path aliasing: @/_ maps to src/_
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Comprehensive ESLint rules for React, Next.js, imports, and accessibility
- Automated code formatting with Prettier

## Project Type

Modern Next.js application template optimized for:

- Full-stack web applications
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- API development with Route Handlers
- Progressive Web Apps (PWA) potential

## Architecture Philosophy

- Clean separation of concerns
- Feature-based organization
- Server-first approach with selective client-side interactivity
- Type safety throughout the codebase
- Accessibility and performance as first-class concerns
